# bls-crypto

A more actively maintained version of the bls-crypto crate in https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-snark-rs, to avoid needing to update the Plumo circuit in the latter and causing issues with the current Espero circuit-specific trusted setup. This repo should be preferentially used until celo-bls-snark-rs has been updated.
